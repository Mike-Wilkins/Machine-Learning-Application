# Overview

Non-verbal forms of communication such as facial expressions provide a unique insight into the emotional state and feelings of human beings. However, the process of encapsulating the subtle physiological and psychological variances that occur naturally within human expressions remains a significant challenge. This application focuses on an investigation into the relationship between convolutional neural networks (CNN) and facial expression recognition (FER) based problems. The CNN architecture is based on the VGG-16 proposed by Simonyan(2015) and trained using the Extended Cohn Kanade (CK+) dataset.
