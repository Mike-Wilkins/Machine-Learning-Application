# Facial Expression Recognition Application

As a final project for my MSc I developed a Machine Learning application targeted at recognising human facial expressions. The project 
focused on an investigation into the relationship between convolutional neural networks (CNN) and facial expression recognition (FER) based problems.

## Features

- Programmed in Python, Keras and Tensorflow using Google Colab
- Deployed using Convolution Neural Network design principals
- Achieved 97% accuracy when trained using the Cohn Kanade (CK+) FER dataset
